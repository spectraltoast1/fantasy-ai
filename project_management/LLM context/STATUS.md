## Project Overview (what are we working toward)

Winning a redraft fantasy football championship is about more than just collecting all of the best players. It is about how you manage your specific team in your specific league. Knowing when you need to act - or not act - as a team manager is as valuable as knowing which individual players to target or avoid. This tool focuses on helping you navigate your league using real data signals: how your team is trending, where your real weaknesses are, and what your opponents look like. The goal is fewer decisions driven by anxiety or noise, and more decisions made on league-winning signal.

The project will do this in two ways: a dashboard for user-driven insight and an AI layer for interpretation and decision suggestions. The AI layer is not meant to run the team - it's a consultation, putting data-driven suggestions alongside the user's own analysis to produce better decisions.

**Phase 3 COMPLETE — Positional Depth (§6) ships: the VOR read re-sliced by position vs. league.**
The **4th and last** Phase-3 cash-in read, and the third re-aggregation of the Production VOR
substrate (after True Rank §5). `compute_positional_depth.py` → `derived/positional_depth_2025.parquet`,
per (as_of_week, roster_id, **fine position** QB/RB/WR/TE — not VOR's QB/FLEX pool, since the value
is per-position "deep at WR, thin at TE"). Per law 3 it borrows nothing new — it re-slices the borrowed
`ros_value`/`vor` **net of the position's dedicated starting requirement** (`starter_need` from
`lineup_slots`: QB1/RB2/WR2/TE1; the shared FLEX×2 is *excluded*, so flex-worthy depth surfaces as
surplus — which is exactly what makes it trade capital). Each row carries `starter_value`,
`surplus_value` + `surplus_startable` (beyond-need players clearing the waiver line, vor>0 = real
depth), `marginal_vor` (the last dedicated starter's VOR — the **gap indicator**, ≤0 = starting
replacement level), a league-relative `spectrum_pos` **within each position cohort** (the "vs league"
benchmark), and an **advisory** `surplus/adequate/gap` `shape` (evidence-first; numbers lead, the
manager adjudicates the trade/waiver — per the advisory-framing principle). **One row per (team,
position) even at zero roster count**, so a body-count gap isn't invisible in a rostered-only frame.
Tall over as_of_week (roster-as-of-N inherited from the VOR slice). **Verified 2025 wk4:** 40 rows
(10 teams × 4 pos); the re-slice is **lossless** — per-position `rostered_value` sums back to the
team's total VOR `ros_value` (diff ~4e-13); shape split 26 adequate / 8 gap / 6 surplus; a weak-QB
roster flags a QB gap (`marginal_vor` −1.478, worst in league). **Gate** (`backtest_positional_depth.py`,
exit 0): per position, projected `starter_value` tracks each team's **actual ROS ceiling** (top-need
by realized points — management-independent, the True-Rank answer-key style) at **QB 0.792 / RB 0.867
/ WR 0.855 / TE 0.928, mean 0.861** (freeze wk4, n=10/pos, floor 0.50); the top half by projected
strength out-produces the bottom half by **+85.3** actual ceiling. Small-sample honest (freeze is the
gate; pooled Pearson 0.971 is evidence). `data_layer.write/read_positional_depth`; no UI (data + gate,
like VOR/True Rank). **This closes the Phase-3 read set (4/4).** **Next — Phase 4 (integration + going
live):** the §5 bracket-math Monte Carlo (the full posture read, consumes True Rank + weekly-spread
variance), the §2 ROS-outcome-shape quantitative skeleton, and manager dossiers (§7) — plus the
deliberate **front-end surfacing** of these four gated forward reads (VOR/True Rank/Positional
Depth/Spread), which have shipped as data only. Cross-source disagreement (Phase-2 2nd half) stays
blocked at the freeze → in-season ffanalytics.

> earlier build
**Phase 3 — True Rank (§5, first half) ships: team roster strength from the borrowed VOR.** The
2nd of the four Phase-3 cash-in reads to consume the substrate (after §3 spread + §4 VOR) and the
first **league-level** one. `compute_true_rank.py` → `derived/true_rank_2025.parquet` sums each
team's **optimal-lineup** ROS value (fill the declared QB/RB/WR/TE + FLEX slots from the roster by
`ros_value`, most-constrained slot first, sum the starters) into a **record-independent**
roster-strength rank. **No new engine** (law 3 all the way down): it re-aggregates the Production
VOR that just landed over the league's lineup rules — the optimal-lineup greedy was **lifted from
`compute_team_leakage` into `_analytics` as shared `expand_slots`/`optimal_lineup`** (pure,
points-agnostic; leakage now imports them aliased, behavior-preserving) and fed `ros_value` as its
`pts`. Tall over `as_of_week` (roster-as-of-N inherited free from the VOR slice); carries
`bench_value` (depth / a §6 trade-capital hint) + a league-relative `spectrum_pos`. **Slot-aware
payoff, verified on 2025:** roster 9 holds the single biggest ROS player (a 310-pt QB) yet ranks
**9th of 10** — one QB slot means a 2nd elite QB rides the bench and can't inflate strength; True
Rank rewards a balanced *startable* lineup, not capped-position hoarding (a naive roster-sum gets
this backwards). Ranks reshuffle across as-of weeks (roster-as-of-N moving). **Gate**
(`backtest_true_rank.py`, exit 0): projected roster strength tracks each team's **actual ROS
ceiling** — management-independent (optimal lineup set weekly on realized points, so it measures
roster *quality*, not lineup-setting skill, which is leakage's domain) — at **Pearson 0.802 /
Spearman 0.842** (freeze wk 4, n=10 teams, floor 0.60); the strong half out-produces the weak half
by **+261.7 ROS pts**. Small-sample honest: the **freeze snapshot is the gate**, the
pooled-over-weeks corr is evidence only (the same team at N=1..4 isn't independent). **Data-layer
add:** `_as_of_slice` gains an `"all"` sentinel so a re-aggregating consumer reads the whole tall
frame through the seam (no direct `read_parquet`). No UI (data + gate only, like VOR — a front-end
follow-up). **Next:** **Positional Depth (§6)** is now the *sole* remaining Phase-3 cash-in read (a
re-slice of VOR by position vs. league); cross-source disagreement stays blocked at the freeze
(Phase-2 2nd half → in-season ffanalytics); ROS outcome-shape (§2) is Phase 4.

> earlier build
**Phase 2 — archetype skew (§3 c3) completes the spread band + Production VOR (§4) ships as
the first read that consumes the substrate.** Two builds this session, both answer-key gated.
**(1) Archetype skew** finishes the §3 weekly band to full 3-component spec (center ✓, width ✓,
skew ✓). The band was symmetric bar the floor-at-0; skew adds principled right-skew so **both
tails** calibrate, not just the combined middle. **The design fork was resolved by the answer
key, not §3's literal wording:** §3 names "archetype from opportunity (volume vs big-play
dependence)" as the driver, but measured on 2025 the projection's **TD-dependence does not track
residual skew** (high-TD players skew 0.64, low-TD 0.89 — backwards + negligible). What does: the
player's **own residual skewness** (3rd moment) shrunk to a full-pool positional prior — the exact
parallel to how the width uses the residual 2nd moment, one moment up (new pure `_analytics.skewness`,
`SKEW_SHRINK_K=8` since a 3rd moment is noisier than a variance). Mechanism: a Cornish-Fisher
quantile shift `SKEW_GAIN·(g/6)·(BAND_Z²−1)` on both breakpoints, p50 stays the borrowed center
(law 3). Because `BAND_Z<1`, a right-skewed residual (g>0, the universal case) shifts both
breakpoints **down** — the borrowed center sits *above* the realized median (projections lean
mildly optimistic), so honest 25/25 tails want a slightly longer *lower* gap (this **reverses**
§3's right-skew illustration, which was pre-data intuition about raw scores; documented). **Gate
extended** from combined-coverage-only to **per-tail** (below-p25 / above-p75 each ~0.25), joint
`BAND_Z × SKEW_GAIN` sweep; `(0.55, 1.5)` is the 2025 optimum — combined coverage 0.493, tails
0.247/0.261 (was 0.278/0.208; **tail error cut 5×**, 0.070→0.014), exit 0. **(2) Production VOR**
is the first read that *consumes* the projection substrate (adds/drops layer). Per rostered player,
rest-of-season production value = sum of the borrowed weekly consensus centers over the remaining
schedule (weeks > N), anchored **waiver line = 0** and normalized by the **pool spread** (top −
waiver, §4's settled choice), so QB and flex land on one comparable unit-free scale (top ≈ 1,
negative = dead weight). Pools from `lineup_slots` (not hard-coded): dedicated QB slot = its own
pool, flex-eligible RB/WR/TE = one pooled waiver line (§4 flex reconciliation). **Tall over
as_of_week** (roster-as-of-N via the shared `arg_max` idiom; roster frozen wks 1–4, projection
horizon → wk 18); new `data_layer.write/read_production_vor`. **Gate** (`backtest_production_vor.py`,
exit 0): projected ROS tracks actual rest-of-season production at **corr 0.944 (QB) / 0.955 (FLEX)**
(floor 0.60), VOR tiers cleanly monotonic in realized production (dead 70.7 < mid 138.7 < stud
220.7). The **1QB-compressed QB pool** (a real low-end starter sits on waivers → tiny QB spread)
falls out correctly — §4's "QBs replaceable in 1QB, gold in superflex." **Documented simplifications:**
the pooled flex line doesn't model dedicated-slot scarcity (scarce TE measured vs the flex
replacement); superflex (QB→flex pool) is the latent assumption; Market VOR + the trade gap are V4.
**Next:** cross-source **disagreement** (in-season ffanalytics), then the remaining reads — Positional
Depth (§6, a re-slice of VOR) and True rank (half of §5, VOR aggregated to optimal-lineup roster
strength) are now near-term (they consume the VOR that just landed), plus ROS outcome-shape (§2).

    - Team Overview refinement — Form lens → recency-weighted EWMA slope (half-life 2wk, ±4%/wk direction band, recency-faded weekly bars); computeForm() rewritten [backlog item 2]
    - Team Overview refinement — Lens-4 reframe (retrospective → improvement): efficiency-led, season points-left split into variance vs coachable (repeatable >10% bench-over-starter fix, sum-exact), named-miss list replaced by one rate-gap fix; computeLeakage() takes season role+rate map [backlog item 1]
    - Architecture refactor — form + leakage analytics extracted from queries.js → Python transforms (compute_team_form.py + compute_team_leakage.py → snapshots/derived/), tuning constants moved with them; queries.js slimmed to a thin read+assemble seam (−253 lines); loadTeamDetails efficiency consolidated to read the leakage parquet. View components untouched.
    - Phase 1 spike signal-quality engine — compute_player_signal.py → derived/player_signal_{season}.parquet (opportunity-vs-efficiency decomposition, regression_risk, sample-gated read); backtest_player_signal.py validates the shipped function against the full-2025 answer key (beats naive recent-points 13% on MAE; spike group regresses ~3.9 pts/g while sticky holds). First decision-critique slice; data + backtest only, no UI yet.
    - Phase 1 Players sub-view — sortable table surfacing the signal read per player (recent /g, directional verdict, volume rank, TD share); loadTeamPlayers(rosterId) seam reads player_signal.parquet (no JS math); direction-not-projection, question-framed (laws 2+4), sample-gated. The front end's first decision-coach surface.
    - Phase 1 per-panel readiness gate — readiness.jsx (assessReadiness + Gate): per-panel regime (structural/point-in-time/trend) → ready/building/tooEarly, with a "too early" fallback slot (accepts preseason content later) and an early-read note when building; wired into the Team tab (?weeksOverride=N for QA). Closes Phase 1.
    - leaguelogs snapshot reliability — snapshot() rewritten to write incrementally (cumulative today's-rows persisted after each profile) so a mid-run API failure leaves a recoverable partial day instead of discarding the whole run; idempotent re-run replaces a partial day (dedup on snapshot_date). 2026-06-18 captured (5 profiles, 3,409 rows; history → 14 dates). Follow-up still open: retry/backoff + off-laptop host.
    - Season-replay backend (Session A; parts 1–3) — `as_of_week` first-class column on the three derived analytics; tall grain `(season, as_of_week, entity)` materialized N=1..maxweek (each transform loops, filtering input to `week ≤ N`). Roster-as-of-N correctness fix falls out of that filter (`arg_max(week)` → "latest week ≤ N"). Per-analytic windowing framework: injected EWMA half-life via shared `_weighted_rates`; `backtest_player_signal.py --sweep` tunes the opportunity half-life on the 2025 answer key → ships cumulative (tested, not guessed). `data_layer` reads take optional `as_of_week` (default latest); `queries.js` default-latest guard keeps the front end on week 4. **Front-end week selector is Session B.**
    - Season-replay front-end (Session B; part 4 — grouping COMPLETE) — global "As of" week dropdown in the App shell (`App.jsx`); one selection drives League + Team and persists across tabs. `queries.js` threads `asOfWeek` via `asOfSlice(table, n)` (pick the week-N slice of the tall derived parquets) + `weekCutoff(n)` (bound inline `season.parquet` reads to `week ≤ N`, including `SQL_CURRENT_TEAM`'s `arg_max(roster_id, week)` → front-end roster-as-of-N); `n == null` ⇒ latest, so defaults are unchanged. New `loadWeeks()` feeds the dropdown (weeks 1..latest, default = latest = current week; travels back only). Readiness gate now runs off the selected week (`weeksElapsed = asOfWeek`); the temporary `?weeksOverride` QA param is retired. Verified live across weeks 1–4 (cutoff reshuffles rankings; trend panels degrade to too-early; roster-as-of-N departed flags; no console errors).
    - Phase 1 refinement — Opportunity to spec (`quality_rate`, `direction`/`reliability`, `security`, `point_correlation`) — see "most recent build" above for the full breakdown. `nfl_stats.py` gains a PBP-derived quality signal (`xtd`/`redzone_touches`); `sleeper.py`'s `fetch_players()` carries injury/depth-chart fields through. 2025 backtest gate unchanged (PASS/PASS, 13.2% MAE cut).
    - Data-layer I/O consistency — all fetcher parquet I/O routed through `data_layer.py` (Option-A coverage gap from a Phase 1 build audit). Added write_player_id_map / write_sleeper_players (+exists/age) / write_nfl_stats(week=) / write_sleeper_matchups / read+write_sleeper_transactions; rewired nfl_stats.py, sleeper.py (`_write_parquet_from_list` → `_rows_to_df` + `_snapshot_list`), audit_join.py. Raw JSON cache dumps kept as a documented fetcher exception. TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE truthed-up (fetchers in the I/O rule; LeagueLogs collect-only exception; MIN_GAMES 2→3 places). Behavior-preserving (byte-identical player_signal reproduction; backtest PASS/PASS).
    - Phase 2 projection substrate, source #1 (Sleeper) — multi-source `projections` entity in data_layer (write/read_projections; `source` a column on one growing snapshots/projections/projections_{season}.parquet; snapshot/append, dedup on (season,week,source)); `sleeper.py projections <season> [week]` mode pulls the NFL skill pool's weekly projections from api.sleeper.com (RotoWire), native sleeperPlayerId, QB/RB/WR/TE. 2025 backfilled wks 1–18 (54,594 rows); 100% coverage of rostered skill players at W1–4. FantasyPros joins later in-season via the same seam.
    - Phase 2 projection consensus + spread band — compute_projection_consensus.py → derived/projection_consensus_{season}.parquet (per week×player over the whole skill pool): borrowed consensus center + p25/p50/p75 band from the player's residual std (actual−proj) shrunk toward a full-pool positional prior, BAND_Z-scaled, floored at 0; disagreement_ppr column null under one source. Calibration-gated (backtest_projection_consensus.py, exit 0): 25–75 coverage 51.4% on the 2025 answer key, BAND_Z=0.6 swept-tuned; per-player shrink beats a naive one-size band on stratum uniformity. New _analytics.stdev + data_layer write/read_projection_consensus. 2nd source scouted: ffanalytics (in-season live disagreement), ESPN (deferred historical).
    - Phase 2 archetype skew (§3 c3) — completes the spread band to full 3-component spec. compute_projection_consensus.py gains a Cornish-Fisher skew shift (SKEW_GAIN·(g/6)·(BAND_Z²−1)) on p25/p75 driven by the player's residual skewness shrunk to a positional prior (new _analytics.skewness, SKEW_SHRINK_K=8); p50 stays the borrowed center. Design fork resolved by the answer key: the projection's TD-dependence archetype does NOT track residual skew (measured), the player's own residual 3rd moment does. Because BAND_Z<1 the shift moves both breakpoints down (center sits above realized median). Gate extended to per-tail calibration + joint BAND_Z×SKEW_GAIN sweep → (0.55, 1.5): coverage 0.493, tails 0.247/0.261 (tail error cut 5×), exit 0. No schema change to data_layer (new skew_ppr/resid_skew columns pass through).
    - Phase 2 Production VOR (§4) — compute_production_vor.py → derived/production_vor_{season}.parquet, the first read that consumes the substrate. Per rostered player: ROS value = sum of borrowed weekly consensus centers over remaining weeks; anchored waiver line=0, normalized by pool spread (top−waiver); QB its own pool, flex-eligible RB/WR/TE share a pooled waiver line (from lineup_slots). Tall over as_of_week (roster-as-of-N, roster frozen wks 1–4, projection horizon wk 18). New data_layer write/read_production_vor. Gate (backtest_production_vor.py, exit 0): projected ROS tracks actual at corr 0.944 QB / 0.955 FLEX, VOR tiers monotonic (dead<mid<stud). Simplifications documented: pooled flex line ignores dedicated-slot scarcity; superflex latent; Market VOR + trade gap V4.
    - Phase 3 True Rank (§5, first half) — compute_true_rank.py → derived/true_rank_{season}.parquet, the first league-level read consuming the substrate. Per team: roster_strength = sum of the optimal-lineup ros_value (fill QB/RB/WR/TE+FLEX from the roster by ros_value, most-constrained slot first) → record-independent roster-strength rank + league-relative spectrum_pos + bench_value. Re-aggregates Production VOR (no new engine); the optimal-lineup greedy lifted from compute_team_leakage into _analytics as shared expand_slots/optimal_lineup (leakage imports them, behavior-preserving). Tall over as_of_week (roster-as-of-N inherited from the VOR slice). New data_layer write/read_true_rank; _as_of_slice gains an "all" sentinel for whole-frame re-aggregation through the seam. Slot-aware: a 2-elite-QB roster ranks by its one startable QB (verified — roster 9 holds a 310-pt QB, ranks 9th of 10). Gate (backtest_true_rank.py, exit 0): projected strength tracks the actual ROS ceiling (mgmt-independent optimal lineup on realized points) at Pearson 0.802 / Spearman 0.842 (freeze wk4, n=10, floor 0.60); strong half +261.7 ROS over weak. No UI (data+gate, like VOR).
    - Phase 3 Positional Depth (§6) — compute_positional_depth.py → derived/positional_depth_{season}.parquet, the 4th and last Phase-3 cash-in read (3rd VOR re-aggregation). Per (as_of_week, roster_id, fine position QB/RB/WR/TE): re-slices the borrowed ros_value/vor net of the position's dedicated starter_need (from lineup_slots; shared FLEX excluded → flex-worthy depth = surplus). Carries starter_value, surplus_value + surplus_startable (beyond-need vor>0), marginal_vor (last dedicated starter's VOR = gap indicator), spectrum_pos within each position cohort, advisory surplus/adequate/gap shape (evidence-first). One row per (team, position) even at zero count (body-count gaps visible). Tall over as_of_week (roster-as-of-N from VOR). New data_layer write/read_positional_depth. Lossless re-slice (per-pos rostered_value sums to team VOR ros_value). Gate (backtest_positional_depth.py, exit 0): per position, projected starter_value tracks actual ROS ceiling (top-need by realized pts) at QB 0.792 / RB 0.867 / WR 0.855 / TE 0.928, mean 0.861 (freeze wk4, n=10/pos, floor 0.50); top half +85.3 over bottom. No UI (data+gate). Closes the Phase-3 read set (4/4).

## Current build target
**Phase 1 (the spike signal-quality slice) is COMPLETE** — all four parts shipped:
(1) the engine (`compute_player_signal.py`), (2) the backtest gate (beats naive
recent-points −13% MAE on the full-2025 answer key), (3) the Players sub-view surface
(sortable table, direction-not-projection, question-framed), and (4) the per-panel
readiness gate (`readiness.jsx` — regimes + fallback slot). The descriptive dashboard
(Phase 0) plus the first decision-critique engine are both done; the project has made
the leap from *showing team state* to *grading a decision against a prior*. Still
frozen at Week 4 of 2025 for building. **The `READ_BUILD_ORDER.md` § Phase 1 "refine to
spec" delta is now also closed** — `quality_rate`/`direction`/`reliability`/`security`/
`point_correlation` bring the shipped engine's Opportunity read up to the full
`DECISION_READS.md` §1 definition (see "most recent build"). No UI surfaces these new
fields yet — that's a front-end follow-up, not blocking Phase 2.

**The Season-replay build grouping is COMPLETE (both sessions shipped).** Session A (the
`as_of_week` backend — parts 1–3) and Session B (the front-end week selector — part 4) are
both done (see the build log): the three derived analytics are tall snapshots over weeks
1–4, roster-as-of-N is fixed (backend + front-end), windowing is declared+tuned per analytic,
and a **global "As of" week dropdown** in the App shell threads the selected week through
`queries.js` (derived reads pick the matching slice; inline SQL reads filter `WHERE week ≤ N`),
drives the readiness gate, and retired the `?weeksOverride` param. Default = latest week
(today week 4); the selector travels back only.

**The Phase-2 substrate is DONE and Phase 3 (cash in the projection) is COMPLETE — all 4 cash-in
reads shipped** — per `READ_BUILD_ORDER.md`'s phase map (the authority the roadmap docs sync to).
Source #1 (Sleeper weekly projections) + the consensus/spread band with **its archetype-skew 3rd
component** (§3), **Production VOR** (§4, the first roster-management read), **True Rank** (§5 first
half, the first league-level read), **and now Positional Depth** (§6) have all landed (see "most
recent build"): the borrowed center + a **calibration-gated, fully-3-component band** is the forward
prior every read leans on; VOR proves the substrate cashes into a real add/drop surface (projected ROS
tracks actual at corr ~0.95); True Rank aggregates that VOR up into a record-independent roster-strength
rank (Pearson 0.802 / Spearman 0.842); Positional Depth re-slices it per position into surplus/gap
(per-position corr mean 0.861). **All four are answer-key gated, data + gate only (no UI yet).**
**Source scouting settled the 2nd source** — no clean historical-2025 projection source exists but
Sleeper, so the **cross-source disagreement** half (the Phase-2 substrate's other ingredient) comes
**in-season via ffanalytics**; ESPN historical is deferred (cookie-gated + `espn_id` join). **Next —
Phase 4 (integration + going live):** the §5 **bracket-math Monte Carlo** (the full posture read —
consumes True Rank + weekly-spread variance → playoff odds), the §2 **ROS outcome-shape** quantitative
skeleton, and **manager dossiers** (§7) — plus the deliberate **front-end surfacing** of the four
gated forward reads (they've shipped as data only). **Blocked, not next:** cross-source disagreement
(Phase 2, needs the live 2nd source). Python/data-layer + front-end work.

## Version Roadmap
→ **Source of truth: `scope docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`** — phase detail, the four
design laws (grade process not outcome; speak only when confident; borrow the
substrate; consultation not autopilot), sequencing logic, and the scope filter.
Summary only here:

- **Phase 0 — Descriptive dashboard** *(done)* — team overview, league standings,
  power rankings. Frozen at Week 4 of 2025.
- **Phase 1 — Spike signal-quality slice** *(current; kickoff target)* — "is this
  production real or noise?" on usage data already fetched; validated against the
  full-2025 answer key before going live.
- **Phase 2 — Projections substrate** *(substrate done; disagreement blocked)* —
  the forward prior (the hinge everything credible depends on). **Source #1 = Sleeper**
  weekly projections + the consensus/spread band shipped; **cross-source disagreement**
  is blocked at the freeze and fills in-season via ffanalytics. Odds/Vegas optional add.
- **Phase 3 — Cash in the projection: the quantitative forward reads** *(COMPLETE —
  §3, §4, §5-half, §6 all done)* — the reads that consume the prior (per `READ_BUILD_ORDER.md`):
  Weekly Spread (§3 ✅), Production VOR (§4 ✅), True rank (half of §5 ✅), Positional Depth
  (§6 ✅). The leakage coachable-fix (backlog #1, regress-to-prior — law 1) lands in
  VOR; the shared-engines generalization is the cross-cutting *how*, not a separate gate.
- **Phase 4 — Go live + opponent modeling** — in-season weekly refresh; opponent
  reads + manager-dossier infra; waiver and trade surfaces.
- **Phase 5 — Model of YOU** — graded decisions compound into a per-manager
  tendency profile that personalizes guidance.
- **Phase 6 — Forward advisory + AI layer (later)** — real-time "better call now";
  AI interpretation over the engines; draft & streaming surfaces.

## Known Scope Exclusions
→ Source of truth: **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md § Known Scope Exclusions** (DST/K, waiver
wire / full player pool, IR roster overages, zero-stat rows). One product note kept here:
**Market value (V1)** is snapshotted daily now to bank the time-series, but the features
that consume it (trade analysis, value-aware rankings) are V4; any UI showing it must
carry the "Powered by LeagueLogs API" attribution.

## Season-replay build grouping — COMPLETE (design record)

**One build grouping, two sessions, done before Phase 2.** Lets the user view the dashboard
*as of any past week N* — the tool exactly as it would have looked through week N, every
analytic recomputed on weeks ≤ N. A real product feature (the week selector), the in-season
"now advances each week" mechanism, and the QA instrument for every future engine. We are
**still frozen at week 4** — this did NOT expand the data; it lets us inspect weeks 1–3 states.

> **STATUS (2026-06-18):** ✅ **DONE — both sessions shipped & merged.** Session A (parts
> 1–3, the `as_of_week` backend + roster-as-of-N + windowing framework) and Session B (part
> 4, the front-end week selector) are complete and verified. The parts 1–4 text below is kept
> as the design record. **Next is Phase 2 (projections substrate)** — see "The step after".

> **Decided design (built reasons in chat 2026-06-18):**

**Part 1 — `as_of_week`, a temporal-snapshot dimension (backend).** Add `as_of_week`
as a first-class **column** on the three derived analytics (`player_signal`,
`team_form`, `team_leakage`). Grain becomes `(season, as_of_week, entity)` — one tall
table per analytic, NOT a file-per-week. This is the warehouse-correct modelling
(survives the eventual DuckDB→SQLite→server migrations) and matches the project's
existing append-snapshot pattern (leaguelogs by `snapshot_date`, the join by `week`) —
the column is *right*, not just convenient; file-per-week is the parquet-tied choice
that a SQLite layer would force you to undo. Each transform gains an as-of-week param:
filter the join to `week ≤ N` **before** computing, emit rows tagged `as_of_week = N`,
materialize all N=1..maxweek (cheap). data_layer read fns take an optional `as_of_week`
(default = latest). Current behavior = `WHERE as_of_week = max(as_of_week)` — nothing
existing breaks.

**Part 2 — windowing, per-analytic, decoupled from the cutoff.** `as_of_week` ⊥
window: the cutoff is *what data exists*; the window is *how data inside the cutoff is
weighted*. Each analytic declares its window by the **stationarity principle** (a
window is a bet about how fast the measured quantity actually drifts):
  - **Cumulative** (all weeks ≤ N, equal weight) → accounting/ledger metrics (leakage
    season points-left; record/all-play) and **structural baselines** (the league
    efficiency mean the spike signal regresses toward — ~stationary, wants max sample).
  - **Decayed (EWMA / half-life)** → state & trend reads: form (already EWMA, half-life
    2wk) and the spike signal's **player role/opportunity** component (role drifts).
  Where decayed, use a **half-life, not a hard rolling window** (smooth, no edge
  discontinuity, uses all data, graceful early-season). Half-life is a per-transform
  injected tuning constant (like `HALF_LIFE_WK`). The decayed windows are
  **backtest-tunable** — extend `backtest_player_signal.py` to sweep the opportunity
  half-life against the 2025 answer key and pick the best; don't guess. (At N ≤ ~2,
  cumulative and decayed converge anyway; the window mostly matters mid/late season.)

**Part 3 — roster-as-of-N (correctness fix; latent bug even today).** The transforms
currently resolve "current team" as `arg_max(roster_id, week)` = the *latest* week (4)
— that's "latest", not "as-of". Under `as_of_week`, roster membership must be "the
roster a player belonged to in their latest week **≤ N**." Thread the cutoff through
**roster resolution**, not just stat aggregation — it changes *who is even on the team*
at week N (trades/adds), not just their numbers. This is the cleanest proof `as_of_week`
is a true dimension; fix it as part of this work.

**Part 4 — the week selector (front-end product feature). ✅ BUILT (Session B).** A
selector that sets the active `as_of_week`, threaded through `queries.js` — derived reads
pick the matching `as_of_week` slice (`asOfSlice`), the still-in-JS SQL reads (power
rankings, construction, vitals, all-play) filter `WHERE week ≤ N` (`weekCutoff`, including
`SQL_CURRENT_TEAM` for front-end roster-as-of-N). Folded into the **readiness gate**
(`weeksElapsed = asOfWeek`) so past-week views render the real `building`/`tooEarly` states;
the temporary `?weeksOverride` QA param is **retired**. Default = latest week; travels back
only. **Resolved decisions:** placement = **global header** (App-shell dropdown, applies
across League + Team, editable from every tab); control = **dropdown** (weeks 1..latest).

**Suggested sequencing (respect the 3-commit cap):**
- ✅ **Session A — backend (DONE 2026-06-18):** parts 1–3 shipped. `as_of_week` in the
  three transforms + roster-as-of-N + windowing framework + data_layer; materialized all
  weeks; extended the backtest with `--sweep` to tune the opportunity half-life (→
  cumulative, tested). Verified per-week parquet contents (week-N slice carries only weeks
  ≤ N; N≤2 all `too_early`; roster = as-of-N for the 7 traded players). For Session B: the
  parquets are now **tall**, and `queries.js` already has a default-latest guard
  (`WHERE as_of_week = (SELECT max …)`) on the three derived reads — the selector
  parameterises that inner `max(as_of_week)`.
- ✅ **Session B — front-end (DONE 2026-06-18):** part 4. Global "As of" dropdown in `App.jsx`
  + threaded the week through `queries.js` (`asOfSlice`/`weekCutoff` + `loadWeeks()`) + panels;
  folded into the readiness gate (`weeksElapsed = asOfWeek`); retired `?weeksOverride`. Verified
  live across weeks 1–4 (week-2 trend panels "too early"; rankings reshuffle to the cutoff;
  roster-as-of-N departed flags; week persists across tabs; no console errors). **Preview
  gotcha (confirmed):** point the worktree's `.claude/launch.json` at a free port (`--port 5273`)
  — a stray 5173 server serves *main's* frontend, not this source.

**Non-goals:** not expanding past week 4; not Phase 2. This is the replay/inspection
layer that precedes Phase 2.

## Refinement backlog — Team Overview (deferred, not blocking)

These refine shipped lenses; pick up alongside or after the Players sub-view.

> ✅ **Done (2026-06-07):** Lens-4 reframe (retrospective → improvement) and the Form
> lens EWMA switch both shipped. ✅ **Done (2026-06-17):** item 2 (per-panel readiness
> gate) shipped as `readiness.jsx` — see the maintenance log. **One backlog item remains:**

1. **Reframe the Lens-4 "coachable" fix from confident imperative → advisory question
   (and own its predictive weakness).** The shipped coachable fix says *"start X over Y
   going forward — +N/g on the season,"* which silently converts a tiny realized sample
   into a forward claim it can't support. **Worked example that exposes it:** at the wk-4
   freeze, Cousin 'Chilling's roster fired *"start Keenan Allen (16.3/g) over A.J. Brown
   (8.8/g) at WR going forward."* Pulling the *actual* rest-of-season from
   `nfl_stats_2025.parquet`: **Brown W5+ = 16.8/g, Allen W5+ = 9.0/g** — a near-total
   reversal; Brown won 7 of the next 10 head-to-heads by +67.7 pts. The call would have
   been backwards. Mechanism: 4 games, equal-weighted, **no talent prior** — Brown's two
   near-zero early games were noise a prior would discount; stars are the *worst* case for
   realized-rate reads. The leakage total is descriptively true (you did leave those
   points in wks 1–3); only the **forward language** overreaches. Directions:
   - **Language (near-term, cheap):** drop the imperative + "+N/g going forward." Pose it
     as a **question the manager adjudicates**, per the project mission (consultation, not
     autopilot): *"Is it time to pivot off Brown? He's scored 8.8/g to Allen's 16.3 over
     4 weeks — past fluke territory; decide if you still believe in him."* Surfaces the
     decision point; defers the call to the user.
   - **Trade-timing angle (V4):** a sustained underperformance isn't only a start/sit
     question — even if you *don't* believe the player rebounds, selling while perceived
     value is high (≈$0.85 on the dollar) beats holding until the market reprices
     (≈$0.35). Ties to the **LeagueLogs market-value** layer (V4). The signal's real job
     is to flag "make a call here," not to make it.
   - **Real fix (V3):** regress realized rate toward a forward prior (FantasyPros
     projections / ADP) before calling anything coachable; gate the language on sample
     size (see item 2). Until then, keep coachable **retrospective**, not predictive.

2. ✅ **DONE (2026-06-17) — Per-panel readiness gate.** Shipped as `readiness.jsx`:
   `assessReadiness(regime, weeks)` + a `Gate` wrapper. Regimes — **structural** (ready at
   roster lock), **point-in-time** (ready week 1, confidence grows), **trend** (ready
   ~week 3–4) — map to ready / building / tooEarly; a **"too early" fallback slot** accepts
   custom children (the preseason-content hook, no rework) and a *building* note calibrates
   language on thin samples. Wired into the Team tab (construction = structural, Form +
   leakage = trend, Players = point-in-time). Frozen at week 4 → all ready; `?weeksOverride=N`
   drives the clock for QA. The deeper "calibrate to a forward prior" half is **Phase 2**
   (projections) — the gate is the seam; the prior that sharpens it comes next.

## Phase 2 — the projections substrate (substrate DONE; disagreement blocked) → Phase 3 COMPLETE

> **Phase labels follow `READ_BUILD_ORDER.md`** (the authority STATUS + PRODUCT_ROADMAP sync
> to): the **substrate** (consensus + spread band) is Phase 2; the reads that **consume** it —
> Weekly Spread §3, VOR §4, True rank half-§5, Positional Depth §6 (**all done**) — are
> Phase 3 "cash in the projection." This section covers the substrate + its progress; the
> Progress list below spans both.

The hinge — **the forward prior** every later decision slice rests on. Delivered as a
**multi-source `projections` entity** (all I/O through `data_layer.py`; keyed on
`sleeperPlayerId`; `source` a column so providers combine/select without a schema change),
plus a transform producing a **consensus + disagreement (spread)** read. Two payoffs: (a) the
spread is the law-2 confidence signal — tight consensus = act, wide = coin-flip; (b) it gives
the spike read a *forward* prior to regress toward, fixing the one honest blind spot the
backtest surfaced (Kamara: usage looked fine, the player declined — usage alone can't see
talent/situation change). It also lets the readiness gate *calibrate* early-season language
rather than merely gate it. Do **not** use prior-season carryover as the prior (biased by
age/injury/scheme).

**Progress:**
- ✅ **Source #1 — Sleeper weekly projections (DONE).** `sleeper.py projections <season> [week]`
  → `write_projections(source="sleeper")`. Historical (works with the frozen-2025 world),
  native `sleeperPlayerId`. See the build log.
- ✅ **Consensus + spread band, all 3 components (DONE).** `compute_projection_consensus.py` →
  `derived/projection_consensus_{season}.parquet`: borrowed consensus **center** + a percentile band
  whose **width** is the player's residual std shrunk to a positional prior + **archetype skew**
  (§3 c3) via a Cornish-Fisher shift from the player's residual *skewness* shrunk to a positional
  prior. Calibration-gated (`backtest_projection_consensus.py`, exit 0) — extended to **per-tail**
  (below-p25/above-p75 ≈ 0.25 each), joint `BAND_Z × SKEW_GAIN` sweep → (0.55, 1.5): coverage 0.493,
  tails 0.247/0.261. Skew driver resolved by the answer key (residual 3rd moment, not the
  TD-dependence archetype §3 names — see "most recent build"). The **cross-source disagreement**
  ingredient stays null under one source, additive when a 2nd lands.
- ✅ **Production VOR (§4) — first substrate-consuming read (DONE).** `compute_production_vor.py` →
  `derived/production_vor_{season}.parquet`: ROS value (borrowed centers summed over remaining weeks)
  over the waiver line, normalized by pool spread; QB pool + pooled flex line from `lineup_slots`;
  tall over as_of_week. Gate (`backtest_production_vor.py`, exit 0): projected ROS tracks actual at
  corr 0.944 QB / 0.955 FLEX, VOR tiers monotonic in realized production. Market VOR + trade gap V4.
- ✅ **True Rank (§5, first half) — first league-level substrate-consuming read (DONE).**
  `compute_true_rank.py` → `derived/true_rank_{season}.parquet`: per team, optimal-lineup ros_value
  sum → record-independent roster-strength rank + spectrum_pos + bench_value; re-aggregates
  Production VOR over the lineup rules (optimal-lineup greedy lifted into `_analytics` as shared
  `expand_slots`/`optimal_lineup`); tall over as_of_week. Gate (`backtest_true_rank.py`, exit 0):
  projected strength tracks the actual ROS ceiling at Pearson 0.802 / Spearman 0.842 (freeze wk4,
  n=10, floor 0.60); strong half +261.7 ROS over weak. Slot-aware (a 2-QB roster ranks by its one
  startable QB). No UI (data+gate). Bracket-math Monte Carlo (§5 full) is Phase 4.
- ✅ **Positional Depth (§6) — the last Phase-3 cash-in read (DONE).** `compute_positional_depth.py` →
  `derived/positional_depth_{season}.parquet`: per (as_of_week, roster_id, fine position QB/RB/WR/TE),
  re-slices VOR net of the position's dedicated `starter_need` (from `lineup_slots`; shared FLEX
  excluded → depth = surplus); carries starter_value, surplus_value/surplus_startable, marginal_vor
  (gap indicator), spectrum_pos per position cohort, advisory surplus/adequate/gap shape; one row per
  (team, position) even at zero count. New `data_layer.write/read_positional_depth`. Lossless re-slice.
  Gate (`backtest_positional_depth.py`, exit 0): per position, projected starter_value tracks the
  actual ROS ceiling at QB 0.792 / RB 0.867 / WR 0.855 / TE 0.928, mean 0.861 (floor 0.50); top half
  +85.3 over bottom. **Closes Phase 3 (4/4).**
- **2nd source — scouted, resolved:** no clean historical-2025 weekly projection source but Sleeper
  (ffanalytics = live-scrape + R; fantasyfootballdatapros = 2019/20 ESPN snapshot + actuals; ESPN =
  cookie-gated + `espn_id` join). Plan: **ffanalytics for the in-season live cross-source
  disagreement** (2026); ESPN historical only if we later want to backtest disagreement against 2025.
- **Next — Phase 4 (integration + going live):** the §5 **bracket-math Monte Carlo** (full posture,
  consumes True Rank + weekly-spread variance), the §2 **ROS outcome-shape** skeleton, **manager
  dossiers** (§7), and the **front-end surfacing** of the four gated forward reads. **Blocked, not
  next:** cross-source **disagreement** (in-season, needs the live 2nd source).
- **Optional cheap add:** Vegas game totals via an `odds.py` fetcher (game environment).

(Older note, lower priority: continue the V1 Dashboard Build Order — standings with
trajectory; manager dossiers; positional strength vs. league average; head-to-head
matchup breakdown — now reframed under the phase roadmap below.)
